# Product-Database

## Description
### This is a product database supporting products logistics within the international business. The current model is still in alpha phase and needs more development, but it works pretty well currently. It can add, search and view products which meets the initial requirements.

## Future innovation
### This database management will be developed later in the year. Some bugs related to changing and saving information will be fixed shortly within the next few weeks. 
### Potential development features would be efficient search (without the need for exact name, maybe using ID like in the store instead?) and transaction data will be stored into a text file so that it can printed out by the end of the week or month, just like in the bank system.
